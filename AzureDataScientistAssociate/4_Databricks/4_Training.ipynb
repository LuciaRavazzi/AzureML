    "Azure DataBricks offers some runtimes to train models in an optimized way taking into account the distributed framework. Otherwise, if you want to install the libraries on your own, it's useless to use a cluster and so a single node is enough.\n",

    "- _transformer_: a transformer takes a DataFrame as an input and returns a new DataFrame as an output. Transformers will implement a .transform() method. and feature engineering methods.\n",
    "- _estimator_: takes a DataFrame as an input and returns a model.\n",
    "- _pipeline_ assembles the first two steps."
