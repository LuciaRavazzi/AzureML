    "It encompasses the following things:\n",
    "- Workspace\n",
    "- Cluster is a set of computational resources on which you run your code. Clusters can be __all-purpose cluster_ shared by multiple users to do collaborative analysis: _job cluster_ is meant to execute a specific job.\n",
    "- Runtimes are the set of core components that run on Azure Databricks clusters. It can be _Databricks runtime_, _Databricks runtime for machine learning_, _Databricks lights_\n",
    "- Data. A _database_ is a collection of tables, a _table_ is a structured data. thei can be imported through UI or mount external data sources. Then, through Spark we can access to our data.\n",
    "- DBFS: Databricks file system. It's a distributed file system mounted into a Databricks workspace and available on Databricks cluster. We can also mount data storage in DBFS."
